However, Bauer-Walsh said the event shook Hamilton Heights community members. More New York Police Department officers were <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-deploys-more-police-to-harlem-after-daytime-shooting-injures-7-year-old">deployed</a> to the area in the days following the incident.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">Bauer-Walsh wrote in a statement to Spectator that he hoped to help host two town halls, the first of which was planned for January at the latest. According to Bauer-Walsh, the first town hall was supposed to be a “grassroots initiative” for local leaders to collaborate on how to “spread accurate information” related to the shooting.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">The second town hall would have been a public forum, open for residents to ask questions and get answers from public officials about public safety and other neighborhood issues. But January passed, and he said the first town hall had not taken place.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">A public safety meeting with local leaders was held on April 7, with Abreu in attendance, according to a photo and statements shared by representatives from Abreu&rsquo;s office. Bauer-Walsh said he was unable to attend this meeting. The second town hall, which would have featured community residents, was not held, according to Bauer-Walsh.</p>

Though she said she thought the town hall was a good idea when she first heard of it, she said she felt somewhat cynical too. “I&rsquo;m not surprised to hear it didn&rsquo;t happen,” she said.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">She said that a town hall would have been crucial in the direct aftermath of the shooting.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">“I think that would have been really, really helpful, honestly, because there&rsquo;s so many families uptown,” Davis said. “This is a family neighborhood. There&rsquo;s so many families in this neighborhood. There&rsquo;s so many schools, there&rsquo;s so many kids and grandparents and aunts and uncles and parents like myself.”</p>

She said Abreu did not directly condemn the detention of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, SIPA &rsquo;24, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the days directly after his March arrest. Abreu <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/11/columbia-and-barnard-faculty-condemn-arrest-of-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-sipa-24-at-press-conference/">spoke at a rally</a> criticizing Khalil&rsquo;s arrest, where he condemned both ICE and the Trump administration.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">Edwards said the town hall likely did not impact a majority of West Harlem residents since many did not know it was happening to begin with. But, he added, a public town hall may be helpful in the wake of traumatic, confusing events such as the shooting.</p>

                    <p class="bg-white p-4 md:p-0 rounded-md shadow-lg md:bg-transparent md:p-0 md:shadow-none">Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the shooting happened within Hamilton Heights and that a public safety meeting with local leaders did not happen on April 7. The shooting happened near Hamilton Heights but not in the jurisdiction of the neighborhood. The public safety meeting with local leaders on April 7 did occur. The article also incorrectly stated that District 7 City Councilmember Shaun Abreu did not directly condemn the arrest of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in the days following Khalil&rsquo;s arrest. Abreu did condemn the arrest of Khalil in at least one instance. Spectator regrets these errors.</p>
